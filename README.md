# Hi there 🐍🐍🐍

I'm Vicky, I mostly code in Python, sometimes in Java, Go, and rarely in JS.
Currently, working at TIW (theintelligentwarehouse.com), Singapore based startup that advanced warehouses with the right tech. 
While not working, I do CTF, machine learning, and other things that keep me busy.

Feel free to contact me if you need anything on vickydasta[at]gmail[dot]com
